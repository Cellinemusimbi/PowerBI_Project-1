**Olympics Data Analysis**:

This project analyzes historical data from the modern Olympic Games, covering the period from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Each record in the dataset represents an athlete's participation in a specific event, including details such as the athlete's name, gender, age, height, weight, country, and the medal won, as well as information about the event itself, such as the sport, year, and city. The goal is to extract insights from the dataset and visualize these findings using Power BI.

**Key Analyses, Insights, and findings**

**Gender Distribution Over Time:**

Analyzed the percentage of female athletes participating in the Olympics over time, noting an increase to 25.07% over the years.

**Summer vs. Winter Games Comparison:**

Compared the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in terms of the number of athletes, countries participating, and events held. Found that summer games had more athletes, more countries participating, and more events compared to winter games.

**Country-Level Trends:**

Identified countries that send the most athletes and examined whether they also tend to win the most medals. Found that USA sends the most athletes (9653) and also USA has won the most medals (5637)

The top 5 countries by participation: USA, GBR, FRA, ITA, GER

The top 5 countries by medals won: USA, URS (Soviet Union), GER, GBR, FRA.

**Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, here are my recommendations;

1.	Keep promoting gender equality in sports. The increasing percentage of female athletes is a positive trend, but there is room for further improvement.
   
2.	Increase support and resources for countries with lower participation in the Winter Olympics to encourage more diverse participation during winter.
   
3.	Implement and enhance athlete development programs, especially in countries that show high participation but lower medal counts. This could help convert participation into podium finishes.

**Process (SQL - Azure SQL Database)**

Imported the data into Power BI by connecting to the database using the SELECT * FROM the table. I intended to get all the data and utilize DAX to create measures before visualizing the data.

**Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the modern Olympic Games, highlighting the evolution of athlete participation, gender representation, and country-level performance over the past 120 years. The interactive Power BI report allows users to explore the data and gain deeper insights into the history and trends of the Olympic Games. These insights can inform future decisions and strategies to enhance the inclusivity, competitiveness, and global reach of the Olympics.
